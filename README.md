Dear Dr.Khalid Alharbi,

Due to a known issue with API-key scrapers, we have removed our API from the project in fear of our API-key being stolen. In order to run our project locally in your machine we have sent our API in our MS Teams DMs. The location of where to enter our firebase API-key is in src/firebase.js Line 6. And our youtube API-key in src/components/home.js Line 8.

With regards, The team.
